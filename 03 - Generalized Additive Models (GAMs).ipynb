    "\n",
    "While linear models are valuable, sometimes we need a bit more flexibility. We have a few options to overcome linearity constraints in our statistical models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Adding higher order parameters to our linear model\n",
    "2. Strictly non-parametric modeling\n",
    "3. Semi-parametric models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Higher Orders in OLS\n",
    "\n",
    "When estimating the effect of age (or experience) on earnings for workers, we frequently discuss a pattern that is called the \"earnings-experience profile\". This pattern looks like the following chart: \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://taxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/PaF-Chart-121.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear that this graph does not demonstrate a linear relationship between age (a proxy for experience) and earnings. It looks much more like a quadratic equation to me. How can we incorporate that functional form into a linear model?\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that OLS's assumptions state that the relationship between a paramter and the dependent variabe be linear, but not necessarily that the parameter itself be linear. What we can do to sidestep this problem is to simply **include non-linear terms in our regression model**. Let's look at a simple regression equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_i = \\alpha + \\beta \\cdot x_i + \\epsilon_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The REQUIRED linearity stipulates that $\\beta \\cdot x_i$ be a linear relationship, or in other words that $\\beta$ be a number (not some other type of functional form). If we want to consider a non-linear relationship between $y$ and $x$, then we can adjust our regression model like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_i = \\alpha + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_{i} + \\beta_2 \\cdot x^2_{i} + \\epsilon_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we still have a linear relationshipe between each parameter and our dependent variable ($y$), but we have created a second parameter based on our original $x$ variable: $x^2$. Thus, we can estimate the quadratic relationship between $x$ and $y$ using linear regression. The marginal effect of increasing $x$ by one unit in this model is no longer $\\beta(x_{old}-x_{new})$. Now, it is $\\beta_1(x_{old}-x_{new}) + \\beta_2(x_{old}^2-x_{new}^2)$, and depends on the **current $x$ values**!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-parametric Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Another alternative is to simply abandon the parametric nature of OLS, and allow our model to assume **any** functional form. Thus, the relationship between $y$ and $x$ could be represented as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_i = f(x_i) + \\epsilon_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f()$ can be any functional form. We can then have ANY relationship between $x$ and $y$, and are not hindered by any restrictions or assumptions in our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why don't we do this? I'll give you two reasons. First, it quickly becomes computationally intensive. The most common method for estimation of non-parametric models is through **kernel regression** (you can also use **regression trees** and several other tools, though). These models require large amounts of data in order to estimate, because each portion of the resulting model is in effect calculated based on the nearest observations. This also means that each individual point in the model needs to be separately estimated. While this is reasonable for simple regressions, it becomes complex and slow as the number of variables in a model increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, when we estimate an entirely non-parametric model, we are likely to generate interaction terms between variables. This means that the effects of one variable cannot be easily separated from the effects of other variables included in our model. If we have two $x$ parameters ($x_1, x_2$), our model can be written\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_i = f(x_1, x_2) + \\epsilon_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the marginal effects of these parameters given the model specified will be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ ME_1 = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1} $$\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ ME_2 = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2} .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we have lost the ability to quickly interpret our marginal effects, and must generate estimates **at any specific observation** of the marginal effect of changes to inputs. In order to have a more flexible model, we have sacrificed both ease of calculation as well as ease of interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we really need is some sort of middle ground, and this can be achieved through **Generalized Additive Models**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalized Additive Models, or GAMs, provide a nice middle ground between linear models and non-parametric modeling by opening a subclass of non-parametric models to analyze data, while also attempting to preserve interpretability. The restricted flexibility of GAMs is rooted in the restriction to **additively separable** functional forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does that mean? Each explanatory variable must have an **additively separable** form in the regression model. To simplify even further, each variable can have ANY functional form so long as that form **does not interact with the functional forms of other variables**. In math speak, it's like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_i = \\sum_{j=1}^K f_j(x_{j,i}) + \\epsilon_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had two variables again ($x_1, x_2$), then our model would be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_i = f_1(x_{1,i}) + f_2(x_{2,i}) + \\epsilon_i. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our functional form for each variable can take any shape, but must be totally separate for each $x$! This is what we call additively separable, because each function can be added together to become the overall estimate of $y$. Additionally, this makes for some really nice properties when interpreting the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each functional form can be separately visualized!\n",
    "- Each functional form relates to only one variable, and so the slope estimates are much easier to calculate when estimating marginal effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive into creating GAMs in Python, and use that experience to learn a bit more about how they work.\n",
